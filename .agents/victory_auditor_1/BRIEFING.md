# BRIEFING — 2026-09-04T06:42:30Z

## Mission
Independently audit and verify the genuine completion of the Mojo Grille platform redesign against all requirements and acceptance criteria in ORIGINAL_REQUEST.md.

## 🔒 My Identity
- Archetype: victory_auditor
- Roles: critic, specialist, auditor, victory_verifier
- Working directory: c:\PaginasWeb\MojoGrille\.agents\victory_auditor_1
- Original parent: 19f7ac68-93c6-43a5-8d74-8a7cab143cbf
- Target: full project (Mojo Grille platform redesign)

## 🔒 Key Constraints
- Audit-only — do NOT modify implementation code
- Trust NOTHING — verify everything independently
- Zero shared context with implementation team
- Independent build and test execution required
- Check for hardcoded test results, fake mocks, facades, stubs
- Verify all design tokens, dual typography, functional flows, SEO & copy

## Audit Scope
- **Work product**: c:\PaginasWeb\MojoGrille\mojo-grille-demo
- **Profile loaded**: General Project / Victory Audit
- **Audit type**: victory audit (Phase A: Timeline, Phase B: Integrity & Cheating, Phase C: Independent Test Execution & Criteria)

## Audit Progress
- **Phase**: reporting
- **Checks completed**:
  - Phase A: Timeline & Provenance Audit (PASS)
  - Phase B: Cheating & Integrity Detection (PASS)
  - Phase C: Independent Test & Build Execution (PASS - 100% pass across all 4 suites & 0-error build)
  - Acceptance criteria validation (ALL 12 criteria PASS)
- **Checks remaining**: None
- **Findings so far**: CLEAN. Complete, authentic, robust implementation.

## Key Decisions Made
- Executed 
pm run typecheck, 
pm run test, 
pm run test:backend, 
pm run test:seo, 
pm run test:qa, and 
pm run build independently from scratch.
- Verified visual tokens (#FAF8F5, #FFFFFF, #EAE5DC, #D95327, #4D7C0F, #F59E0B), dual typography (Playfair Display + Plus Jakarta Sans/Inter), WhatsApp URL encoding, Location switcher, side dish real-time math, and SEO Schema.org graph.

## Artifact Index
- DISPATCH.md — record of dispatch instructions
- progress.md — liveness heartbeat
- BRIEFING.md — situational awareness
- handoff.md — self-contained handoff and victory audit report

## Attack Surface
- **Hypotheses tested**:
  - Codebase might contain fake test outputs or stubs (DISPROVED: verified real logic across all components).
  - Floating-point price math could have rounding inaccuracies (DISPROVED: verified 2,448 combinations against integer-cent oracle).
  - WhatsApp links might break on Spanish diacritics or emojis (DISPROVED: verified 100% roundtrip lossless URL encoding).
  - Location switching might clear or corrupt cart items (DISPROVED: state preserved across Little Havana, Brickell, Doral switches).
  - TypeScript, Vite or Nitro build might have hidden errors (DISPROVED: npm run build completed with 0 errors).
- **Vulnerabilities found**: None.
- **Untested angles**: Live production DNS/domain delegation (out of scope for local build verification).

## Loaded Skills
- None
